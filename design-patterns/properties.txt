Creational class patterns defer some part of object creation to subclasses
Creational object patterns defer it to another object. 
Structural class patterns use inheritance to compose classes. 
Structural object patterns describe ways to assemble objects.
Behavioral class patterns use inheritance to describe algorithms and flow of control
Behavioral object patterns describe how a group of objects cooperate to perform a task that no single object can carry out alone.


PURPOSE							DESIGN PATTERN                 ASPECT(S) THAT CAN VARY

Creational 						Abstract Factory				families of product objects
								Builder							how a composite object gets created					
								Factory Method					subclass of object that is instantiated								
								Prototype						class of object that is instantiated								
								Singleton						the sole instance of a class

 

Structural						Adapter							interface to an object
								Bridge							implementation of an object
								Composite						structure and composition of an object
								Decorator						responsibilities of an object without subclassing
								Facade							interface to a subsystem
								Flyweight						storage costs of objects
								Proxy							how an object is accessed; its location


Behavioral						Chain of Responsibility			object that can fulfill a request
								Command							when and how a request is fulfilled
								Interpreter						grammar and interpretation of a language								
								Iterator						how an aggregate's elements are accessed, traversed
								Mediator						how and which objects interact with each other
								Memento 						what private information is stored outside an object, and when
								Observer                        number of objects that depend on another object; how the dependent objects stay up to date
								State                           states of an object
								Strategy                        an algorithm
								TemplateMethod                  steps of an algorithm
								Visitor                         operations that can be applied to object(s) without changing their class(es)


Creational : Abstracts the instantiation process so that there is a logical separation between
how objects are composed and finally represented.
• Structural : Focuses more on how classes and objects are composed using the different
structural techniques, and to form structures with more or altered flexibility.
• Behavioral : Are concerned with the inner algorithms, process flow, the assignment of
responsibilities and the intercommunication between objects.
