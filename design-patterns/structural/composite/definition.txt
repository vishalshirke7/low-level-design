*What is this pattern about?

The composite pattern describes a group of objects that is treated the
same way as a single instance of the same type of object. The intent of
a composite is to "compose" objects into tree structures to represent
part-whole hierarchies. Implementing the composite pattern lets clients
treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.

*What does this example do?

The example implements a graphic classï¼Œwhich can be either an ellipse
or a composition of several graphics. Every graphic can be printed.

*Where is the pattern used practically?

In graphics editors a shape can be basic or complex. An example of a
simple shape is a line, where a complex shape is a rectangle which is
made of four line objects. Since shapes have many operations in common
such as rendering the shape to screen, and since shapes follow a
part-whole hierarchy, composite pattern can be used to enable the
program to deal with all shapes uniformly.
