- When you create a simplified interface that perfoms many other actions behind the scenes
e.g - Can I withdraw 50 rs form the Bank?
	- Check if the checking amount is valid 
	- Check if the security code is vaid
	- Check if funds are available
	- Make changes accordingly 

*What is this pattern about?
The Facade pattern is a way to provide a simpler unified interface to
a more complex system. It provides an easier way to access functions
of the underlying system by providing a single entry point.
This kind of abstraction is seen in many real life situations. For
example, we can turn on a computer by just pressing a button, but in
fact there are many procedures and operations done when that happens
(e.g., loading programs from disk to memory). In this case, the button
serves as an unified interface to all the underlying procedures to
turn on a computer.

*Where is the pattern used practically?
This pattern can be seen in the Python standard library when we use
the isdir function. Although a user simply uses this function to know
whether a path refers to a directory, the system makes a few
operations and calls other modules (e.g., os.stat) to give the result.

Provides a simpler unified interface to a complex system.
