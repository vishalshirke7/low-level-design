Allows 2 incompatible interfaces to work together
Used wen a client expects a (target) interface
The Adapter class allows the use of available interface and the target interface
Any class can work together as long as the Adapter solves the issue that all classes must implement
every method defined by the shared interface


The Adapter pattern provides a different interface for a class. We can
think about it as a cable adapter that allows you to charge a phone
somewhere that has outlets in a different shape. Following this idea,
the Adapter pattern is useful to integrate classes that couldn't be
integrated due to their incompatible interfaces.
*What does this example do?
The example has classes that represent entities (Dog, Cat, Human, Car)
that make different noises. The Adapter class provides a different
interface to the original methods that make such noises. So the
original interfaces (e.g., bark and meow) are available under a
different name: make_noise.
*Where is the pattern used practically?
The Grok framework uses adapters to make objects work with a
particular API without modifying the objects themselves:

Allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface.
