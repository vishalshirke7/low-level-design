*What is this pattern about?

The Chain of responsibility is an object oriented version of the
`if ... elif ... elif ... else ...` idiom, with the
benefit that the conditionâ€“action blocks can be dynamically rearranged
and reconfigured at runtime.

This pattern aims to decouple the senders of a request from its
receivers by allowing request to move through chained
receivers until it is handled.

Request receiver in simple form keeps a reference to a single successor.
As a variation some receivers may be capable of sending requests out
in several directions, forming a `tree of responsibility`.

Allow a request to pass down a chain of receivers until it is handled.
